# RocketDB

RocketDB is a work-in-progress database manager that supports both remote and local databases.

# Goal

The goal is to build a python based database manager, with both an api and a tool. To allow for both local and remote databases.
RocketDB will also have a web-gui for managing your databases in an easy and manageable way.
Databases build with RocketDB will be scaleable, secure and with opportunity to switch between web and local storage anytime.

# Status

RocketDB is still in early development, and does not have any utility at this current time.
